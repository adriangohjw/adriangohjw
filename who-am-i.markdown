# A little about what I do at NodeFlair...

The world today runs on code written by developers that solve the world’s problems and impact lives.

Now, imagine a world where developers get to code at a place where they find purpose in their work. This meaning could translate into drive that pushes boundaries to solve more of the world’s problems.

That’s why at [NodeFlair][nodeflair-website], we make it our mission to improve the world by empowering developers to code() at where they love.
