<h1><b>A little about what I do at NodeFlair…</b></h1>

<p>The world today runs on code written by developers that solve the world’s problems and impact lives.</p>

<p>Now, imagine a world where developers get to code at a place where they find purpose in their work. This meaning could translate into drive that pushes boundaries to solve more of the world’s problems.</p>

<p>That’s why at <a href="https://nodeflair.com">NodeFlair</a>, we make it our mission to improve the world by empowering developers to code() at where they love.</p>
